	<h1> the flash tag</h1>
		<p>A depricated tag from the bad old days of the browser wars. The flash tag would actually cause anything inside of it to flash to draw attention. It was super annoying
		Thankfully it's been depricated and with HTML 5 we no longer have tags that only work on certain browsers or are designed to annoy
