<h1> Document Type declaration </h1>
<p1> To begin an html document you are required to begin each page with a Document Type Declaration. When displaying in a browser, the doctype helps 
the browser to define the rendering mode. It's purpose origionaly was to enable parsing and validation of HTML docs using SGML tools based 
on the Document Type Definition (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted 
and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of 
SGML and by consequence do not read the DTD. </p1>
