	<h1>The Iframe</h1>
		<p> the iframe tag is a much maligned tag for it's ability to serve up malware. But there's nothing essentially wrong with the iframe tag in and off its self. Iframe is a powerful tag that allows you to load another web page inside the webpage you're creating. This can be a powerful tool for loading in, say, extra analytical scripts after or the rest of your page has loaded or even adds. But this is dangerous because if you do not control the page you're src-ing in the iframe you're essentially handing security control over to another web page. Make sure you always trust the creater of any page you put into an iframe tag!
